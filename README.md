# Temperature-Controlled-Fan

The aim of the project is to control the speed of the fan, based on the temperatue of the environment

This contains details about a mini project temperature controlled fan, using 8051 Micro Controller (coded in Assembly Language) along with some additional electronic components like LM35 (temperature sensor), ADC0804, Motor Driver and a DC Motor to replicate a fan.

The simulation has been done in the Proteus Simulation Software

The report contains a clear description about the working of the project.
